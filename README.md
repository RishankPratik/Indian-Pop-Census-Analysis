# Indian-Pop-Census-Analysis

We are analysing the population based on various factors like literacy, male to female ratio, growth factors, etc. Now you may ask what is the point of doing such an analysis? Well, the thing is that such analysis is the foundation of a nationâ€™s growth and development and any government requires this data and analysis to assist them in designing schemes, plans and budgets according to the growth to control the well-being of its citizens. Our curiosity leads us to describe the major populations relations for beneficial purposes.

We used the 2011 Indian census dataset since the 2021 Indian census is yet to be published. So, our analysis obviously cannot be used to mark out patterns for the real time scenario. If done, this could lead to huge miscalculations and the results could be misleading.
